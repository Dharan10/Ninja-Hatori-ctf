# Security Analysis

## Implemented Security Measures

### Authentication & Session Management
- Flask session management with secure cookies
- HTTPOnly and SameSite cookies
- Session lifetime: 2 hours
- Secure flag for HTTPS environments

### Input Validation
- Flag format validation (must start with 'nhc{' and end with '}')
- Length limits on inputs (100 chars for flags)
- CSRF tokens on all forms

### Rate Limiting
- 5 requests per minute for map page
- 10 requests per minute for challenges
- Prevents brute force attacks

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Default source: self
- Script source: self + unsafe-inline (for educational XSS)
- Style source: self + unsafe-inline + Google Fonts

### Database Security
- Parameterized queries (except intentional SQLi)
- SQLite database with proper permissions
- No direct user input in queries (except shrine challenge)

### Docker Security
- Multi-stage build to minimize attack surface
- Non-root user execution
- Minimal base image (python:3.9-slim)
- No unnecessary packages

### Logging
- Request logging with IP addresses
- Error logging for debugging
- Warning logs for suspicious activities

## Intentional Vulnerabilities

### Educational Purpose
All vulnerabilities are intentional for learning:

1. **Cavern**: Information disclosure via source inspection
2. **Graveyard**: No vulnerability - pure decoding challenge
3. **Shrine**: SQL injection via string concatenation
4. **Spirit**: XSS via |safe filter
5. **Shadows**: Command injection via os.popen
6. **Flame**: LFI via path manipulation

## Production Considerations

### Environment Variables
- Store secrets in .env files
- Never commit sensitive data
- Use strong, random SECRET_KEY

### HTTPS Enforcement
- Set SESSION_SECURE=True in production
- Use HTTPS certificates
- Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

### Database Hardening
- Use production database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Implement connection pooling
- Regular backups

### Monitoring
- Log analysis for suspicious patterns
- Monitor for exploitation attempts
- Set up alerts for security events

## Best Practices Demonstrated

- Principle of least privilege (Docker non-root)
- Defense in depth (multiple security layers)
- Fail-safe defaults (secure cookie settings)
- Input sanitization and validation
- Proper error handling

## Security Testing

### Manual Testing
- Test each vulnerability with provided payloads
- Verify security measures block unauthorized access
- Check session handling and logout functionality

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for core functions
- Integration tests for full workflows
- Security scanning with tools like OWASP ZAP

## Responsible Disclosure

- Vulnerabilities are for educational purposes only
- Do not deploy with real sensitive data
- Use in controlled environments
- Report any unintended vulnerabilities
